# faq
###### what is this place?
> This place meant to host all my interests, so strap in while I type into the ether.
###### why did you make this blog?
> I wanted a place where I can capture all my interests, publish online, and create learning opportunities. I don't believe there is an existing toolset that allows me to create the type of content I want without certain limitations. Let this place be a playground, brain dump, scrapbook of sorts. 
###### who are you?
> Simply a lass with way too many interests, that happens to be rather geeky. My job experience expands over various domains.
