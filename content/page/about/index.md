# faq
## what's with the name?
    Dotfiles are hidden configuration files in unix-like operating systems. These files allow users to add a personal touch their systems. This here blog is my little hidden custom corner on the internet. 
## what is this place?
    This place is meant to host all my interests, so strap in while I type into the ether.
## why did you make this blog?
    I wanted a place where I can capture all my interests, publish online, and create learning opportunities. Let this place be a playground, brain dump, scrapbook of sorts. 
## who are you?
    Simply a lass with way too many interests, that happens to be rather geeky.
